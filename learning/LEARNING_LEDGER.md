# BuildLens — Learning Ledger

## Purpose

CMU's learning principles emphasize that prior knowledge and how knowledge is organized affect later learning. Retrieval practice is most useful when it exposes what can actually be recalled and transferred.

This file tracks **mental-model quality**, not project completion.

Do not log every fact.

Log concepts that matter.

# Concept Entry Template

## Concept

`<name>`

### My explanation

Write from memory before checking documentation.

### Mental picture

```text
draw / ASCII map
```

### Example I can solve

`<example>`

### Transfer example

`<different context>`

### Common mistake / misconception

`<what I previously misunderstood>`

### Evidence I understand it

- [ ] unseen variant
- [ ] second context
- [ ] delayed retrieval
- [ ] teach aloud
- [ ] used in real BuildLens code
- [ ] defended under questioning

### Confidence before check

`0–100%`

### Actual result

`correct / partial / wrong`

### Calibration note

Was confidence too high, too low, or appropriate?

### Next retrieval due

`<phase/date>`

# Status Vocabulary

Use:

```text
NEW
RECOGNIZE
TRACE
EXPLAIN
TRANSFER
DEFEND
MASTERED
```

Do not mark `MASTERED` because a concept feels familiar.

# Weekly Reflection

## 1. What can I now explain that I could not last week?

## 2. What did I think I understood but fail to retrieve?

## 3. Which architecture box/arrow did I forget during reconstruction?

## 4. Which debugging hypothesis was wrong, and why?

## 5. What design decision can I now defend with alternatives and tradeoffs?

## 6. Which concept needs a different-looking transfer problem?

## 7. What should Claude give me *less* help with next week?

# Calibration Rule

Before running code or revealing an answer, record confidence:

```text
Prediction: X
Confidence: 80%
```

Then compare.

The purpose is to learn the difference between:

```text
"I recognize this"
and
"I can actually predict/explain this"
```

A confidently wrong answer is especially useful study material.

# Architecture Reconstruction Log

Once per week:

```text
VIEW:
module / runtime / data / deployment / failure

REMEMBERED:
...

MISSING:
...

WRONG CONNECTION:
...

WHY I MISSED IT:
...

NEXT EXERCISE:
...
```

Do not merely redraw the missing arrow afterward.

Create a retrieval/transfer exercise around it.


# Decision Defense Entry

For every major architectural choice, occasionally retrieve this **without opening the ADR**:

```text
DECISION:
...

CONSTRAINT THAT MATTERED:
...

QUALITY I OPTIMIZED FOR:
...

CREDIBLE ALTERNATIVE:
...

WHY MY CHOICE WORKS — MECHANISM:
...

DOWNSIDE I ACCEPTED:
...

EVIDENCE I HAVE:
...

EVIDENCE I DO NOT HAVE YET:
...

WHAT WOULD HAVE TO BE TRUE TO REVERSE IT:
...

45-SECOND SPOKEN ANSWER:
...
```

Then have Claude challenge the answer using the five-round defense in `docs/DESIGN_REVIEW_RUBRIC.md`.

# Systems Connection Entry

When a new boundary appears, record one connection:

```text
APPLICATION CONCEPT:
e.g. subprocess.run

UNDERLYING SYSTEM CONCEPT:
child process + stdout/stderr + exit status

FAILURE I CAN NOW EXPLAIN:
non-zero exit / timeout / unavailable executable

WHAT I STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND:
...
```

The goal is gradual depth, not pretending every abstraction has been mastered.
