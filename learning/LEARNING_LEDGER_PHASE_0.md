  ## Phase 0 tracing exercise

  Do not run this yet.

  ```python
  def revise(amount, step):
      amount = amount + step

      if amount % 2 == 0:
          amount = amount // 2
      else:
          amount = amount + 3

      return amount


  starting = 5
  first = revise(starting, 3)
  second = revise(first, starting)

  print(starting, first, second)
  ```

  Commit to:

  1. The exact printed output.
  2. The final values of `starting`, `first`, and `second`.
  3. A short explanation of execution order: trace each function call, the parameter values, the branch taken, and the returned value.
  4. Your confidence from 0–100%.

  Do not run it before replying. I will evaluate both your result and your reasoning before we verify it.

  **Correct answer/explanation — added only after preserving the original**

  ```text
  The exact output is `5 4 12`. The first call receives 5 and 3, computes 8, takes the even branch, and returns 4. The second receives 4 and 5, computes 9, takes the odd branch, and returns 12. Reassigning the local parameter `amount` does not reassign `starting`.

  **Assessment:** `partial`

  **Specific misconception or gap:** `local_reassignment_and_return_expression — the trace correctly assigned local marker = "i" in the second call but then evaluated the return using the old marker and omitted the full local word. exact_case_tracking also remained inconsistent because "Go" was written as "GO" during the trace.`

  **Correct answer/explanation — added only after preserving the original**

  ```text
  The exact output is `Go GGox iHi`. The first call receives `word = "Go"` and `marker = "G"`; the condition is true, so local `word` becomes `"Gox"`, and the return is `"G" + "Gox"`, which is `"GGox"`. The second call receives `word = "Hi"` and `marker = "G"`; the condition is false, so local `marker` becomes `word[-1]`, which is `"i"`. The return expression then uses the current local values: `"i" + "Hi"`, which is `"iHi"`. `seed` remains `"Go"`.

The original response remains unchanged; the clarification is preserved separately.`

  **Correct answer/explanation — added only after preserving the original**
